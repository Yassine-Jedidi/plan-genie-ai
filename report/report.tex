\vspace{1cm}

In today's busy world, managing tasks and events effectively is very important for both personal and work productivity. Traditional ways of managing tasks and events are often slow, make mistakes, and don't adapt to what users prefer.

This project introduces \textbf{Plan Genie AI}, a smart task and event management platform that uses artificial intelligence to change how people and organizations plan, organize, and track their activities. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and data analysis to provide a smooth, intelligent, and easy-to-use experience.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Main Goals:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Build an AI platform that can understand and process natural language for creating tasks and planning events
    \item Add speech-to-text features to allow voice-based task and event management
    \item Provide performance analytics and visualization tools
    \item Ensure data security and privacy protection
    \item Make a responsive application that works on different devices
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The project uses modern technologies including React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Python FastAPI for backend services, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Hugging Face Transformers for advanced NLP features. The system can process multiple languages, extract information automatically, and provide detailed performance analytics through interactive charts.

\vspace{0.5cm}

This report shows the complete development process of Plan Genie AI, from initial idea and requirements through design, building, testing, and deployment. It demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to solve real productivity problems while maintaining good user experience and data security.

\section{General Framework and Preliminary Study}

\subsection*{Introduction}

The modern workplace and personal life demand efficient management of tasks and events. Traditional task management systems often fall short due to their rigid interfaces, limited automation capabilities, and lack of intelligent features. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the project context, problem statement, and requirements for the Plan Genie AI platform.
